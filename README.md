# 100DaysOfML
This will be my daily log for my 100 days of Ml challenge

## Day 0:  31-Jan-2019
I have accepted the challenge and will start my journey from tomorrow.
I have jotted down what all I will accomplish  for the next week and I will update it when I do it.

## Day 1:  01-Feb-2019
I have finished 3 chapters of Grokking Deep Learning and have implemented a small neural network.

## Day 2:  02-Feb-2019
I have finished 2 more chapters of Grokking Deep Learning and read a paper on backpropogation.

## Day 3: 03-Feb-2019
I went and looked into the documentation for pytorch and read a few blogs about it.

## Day 4: 04-Feb-2019
I started making a flower classifier without any documentation.

## Day 5: 05-Feb-2019
I continued my attempt but couldn't quite make it so decided that I will have to look at another simple model

## Day 6: 06-Feb-2019
I understood the things I was missing and continued my attempt at the classifier

## Day 7: 07-Feb-2019
I completed the classifier but failed the challenge as I had to look at documentation for many things but it was fun, looking back I think it was a stupid challenge. (lol I am not a sore loser okay?)
I completed it using Vgg16 but got less accuracy will try another pretrained model later.

## Day 8: 08-Feb-2019
I tried using Image transformation on the dataset and got much more accuracy than I expected but couldn't train it for a longer time due to Google Colab lol but anyway I will look at Resnet tom.

## Day 9: 09:Feb-2019
I have tried it with Resnet152 and it took a lot of time but gave me a better accuracy.

## Day 10: 10-Feb-2019
I have not done much today and just went ahead and watched a few videos of ML implementation and looked at YOLO,
I will read the paper later today and I have classes from tomorrow so am updating earlier.

> As I said earlier my classes will start from tomorrow and I have decided to commit my logs everyday but only push it
> once a week and not after 2 days as I had done till now.

## Day 11: 11-Feb-2019
I didn't read YOLO yesterday but read it today and HOLY SHIT! it's one of the most entertaining paper I have read!
I couldn't belive that someone could write a paper so informally it was a fun read! I will see if I can implement it
though it looks easy but looking at the videos it's so accurate that I think the author just made it look easy.

## Day 12: 12-Feb-2019
Lol, It difficult and there was a lot of stuff involved and looking at a blog to implement it I had to go through
many blogs and found one which implemented it in pytorch and since the original code is in c and written with the lib darknet
he showed how to make it in pytorch and after reading it I thought I have to return to it later as I was having a bit of a hard time properly analysing it.

# Day 13: 13-Feb-2019
I read the 6th chapter of Grokking Deep learning after a long time.

## Day 14: 14-Feb-2019
I watched a few videos from coursera from the second course from Andrew ng.

## Day 15: 15-Feb-2019
I did a few more videos from the coursera course and also read an interesting article Titled Yes, you should understand backprop by Andrej Karpathy a must read!

## Day 16: 16-Feb-2019
I attended a meetup and we did codelabs on utilizing google cloud api's including vision,nlp,translation and a lot more. Since that could be counted towards the 100DaysOfML (and I was tired as well) I didn't do anything else.
