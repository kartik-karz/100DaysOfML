# 100DaysOfML
This will be my daily log for my 100 days of Ml challenge

## Day 0:  31-Jan-2019
I have accepted the challenge and will start my journey from tomorrow.
I have jotted down what all I will accomplish  for the next week and I will update it when I do it.

## Day 1:  01-Feb-2019
I have finished 3 chapters of Grokking Deep Learning and have implemented a small neural network.

## Day 2:  02-Feb-2019
I have finished 2 more chapters of Grokking Deep Learning and read a paper on backpropogation.

## Day 3: 03-Feb-2019
I went and looked into the documentation for pytorch and read a few blogs about it.

## Day 4: 04-Feb-2019
I started making a flower classifier without any documentation.

## Day 5: 05-Feb-2019
I continued my attempt but couldn't quite make it so decided that I will have to look at another simple model

## Day 6: 06-Feb-2019
I understood the things I was missing and continued my attempt at the classifier

## Day 7: 07-Feb-2019
I completed the classifier but failed the challenge as I had to look at documentation for many things but it was fun, looking back I think it was a stupid challenge. (lol I am not a sore loser okay?)
I completed it using Vgg16 but got less accuracy will try another pretrained model later.
